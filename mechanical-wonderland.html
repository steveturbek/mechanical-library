              >South Orange, NJ</a
            >, built two exhibits of mechanical movements which were displayed in a number of museums and the 1934 Chicago World's Fair. One exhibit is on
            display today in the Museum of Science, Boston. The exhibits were inspired by "illustrations and descriptions originally published in 1864 in a
            weekly series in the "American Artisan,"<a href="#2"><sup>2</sup></a
            >a weekly publication edited by Mr. Henry T. Brown, a prominent patent attorney." <a href="#1"><sup>1</sup></a> In 1868, Henry T. Brown published
            the series as the book
            <i
              >'Five hundred and seven mechanical movements : embracing all those which are most important in dynamics, hydraulics, hydrostatics, pneumatics,
              steam engines, mill and other gearing, presses, horology, and miscellaneous machinery : and including many movements never before published, and
              several which have only recently come into use'</i
            ><a href="#3"><sup>3</sup></a
            >. This book and exhibit has gone on to delight and inspire creative works ever since.

            "Mr. Clark, a self-described "hobbyist"<a href="#14"><sup>14</sup></a
            >, "through the help of the '507 Mechanical Movements', acquired the foundation for a mechanical education, without schooling in the regular way."
            The exhibit, originally titled "Mechanical Wonderland," was made over "20 years" by Mr. Clark in the early 1900s.<a href="#14"><sup>14</sup></a>
          </p>

          <p>
            In the 1920's, over 135,000 people saw it in the "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Central_Palace">Grand Central Palace</a>" in New York
            City in one week's period. In 1928, "Mechanical Wonderland" exhibit displayed at the<a

            >

          <p>
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cotton_Dana">John Cotton Dana</a> (1856-1929), the founder and first director of the Newark Museum in
            Newark, New Jersey expressed interest in collecting the exhibit. The Museum was exceptional because it included contemporary American commercial
            products as folk art as well as factory-made products. Dana was quoted as saying, “A great department store, easily reached, open at all hours, is
            more like a good museum of art than any of the museums we have yet established”.<a href="#22"><sup>22</sup></a>

            In 1930 <a href="#16"><sup>16</sup></a
            >, at the request of Mr. Dana, a second exhibit is constructed by W.M. Clark and donated to the Newark Museum by Louis Bamberger, which displays
            <i>"a collection of 160 models of mechanical contrivances which demonstrate 200 standard movements upon which modern industry is founded."</i>
          </p>

          <p>
            At some point in the early 1930's, the Museum of the Peaceful Arts closed. In 1934, Newark Museum collection of "Mechanical Wonderland" exhibited in
            the Chicago World's Fair "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Century_of_Progress">A Century of Progress</a>" and returns to Newark Museum. In
            1937, Newark Museum collection of "Mechanical Wonderland" exhibited at Massachusetts Institute of Technology during the Annual Meeting of the
            Society for the Promotion of Engineering Education and later returns to Newark Museum. In 1930-1940's, New York Museum of Science and Industry opens
            and closes. It is unclear if "Mechanical Wonderland" was displayed. At some point before 1954, Mechanical Wonderland exhibit at Museums of the
            Peaceful Arts is moved to the Museum of Science, Boston
            <a href="#16"><sup>16</sup></a>

            At some point after 1954, The Newark Museum of art placed their copy in storage, where it remains. <a href="#21"><sup>21</sup></a>

South Orange Historical Preservation Society <southorangehistorical@gmail.com> wrote:    
There was a William Clark born 10 Mar, 1862 in South Orange Township, NJ. [The Township included most of what's now Maplewood and South Orange Village.] I believe this is the correct W.M. Clark. In 1907, he built a house at 416 Clark Street; South Orange tax Block 413, Lot 5. 

Here's a link from the Newark Museum: . As of mid-2022, they still had the models. The Museum of Peaceful Arts that you and the write-up mention eventually became the New York Museum of Science and Industry, which closed in the 1940s, according to Wikipedia.

There's a good description of Clark's book at https://books.google.com/books/about/A_Manual_of_Mechanical_Movements.html?id=xovqnQEACAAJ, although this omits the publishing dates. The University of Virginia has a version, copyright 1943, that can be read online at https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uva.x002205697&seq=1. Their citation indicates a birth year of 1869, which conflicts with the South Orange Township birth noted above.

                The AMERICAN ARTISAN is a journal devoted to fostering the interests of Artisans and Manufacturers, encouraging the genius of inventors, and
                protecting the rights of Patentees. It is published every Wednesday morning, at No. 212 BROADWAY (corner of Fulton street), New York, by BROWN,
                COOMBS & CO., Solicitors of American and Foreign Patents.
              </p>

              <p>
                The Proprietors of the AMERICAN ARTISAN believe that its varied and valuable contents are more instructive and interesting than those of any
                other weekly periodical of similar character published in either the United States or Europe. The AMERICAN ARTISAN contains numerous Original
                Engravings and Descriptions of New Machinery, etc., both American and Foreign-Histories of Inventions and Discoveries-Letters from Working-men
                in all parts of the World-Instructions in various Arts and Trades-Reliable Recipes for use in the Field, the Workshop, and the
                Household-News-items for Manufacturers-Practical Rules for Mechanics and Advice to Farmers-Illustrated Details of Useful and Ingenious
                "Mechanical Movements" and other Lessons for Young Artisans-the OFFICIAL List of "Claims " of all Patents issued weekly from the United States
                Patent Office-Reports of Law Cases relating to Patents; the whole forming an Encyclopedia of General Information on a variety of topics
                connected with the Industrial Arts, the Progress of Invention, etc.
              </p>

              <p>
                Each number of the new series of the AMERICAN ARTISAN will contain sixteen pages of instructive and interesting reading matter, in which the
                progress of the arts and sciences will be recorded in familiar language, divested of dry technicalities and abstruse words and phrases. The
                columns of the AMERICAN ARTISAN will be rendered attractive by articles from the pens of many talented American writers upon scientific and
                mechanical subjects. In this journal is published regularly the OFFICIAL list of "claims" of all patents issued weekly from the United States
                Patent Office. Legal decisions in patent cases, tried in the United States Courts, will be periodically presented in the AMERICAN ARTISAN,
                together with descriptions of remarkable inventions recently patented at home or abroad.

              507 Mechanical Movements by Henry T. Brown <a href="#3"><sup>3</sup></a>
            </h3>
            <p>
              The want of a comprehensive collection of illustrations and descriptions of MECHANICAL MOVEMENTS has long been seriously felt by artisans,
              inventors, and students of the mechanic arts. It was the knowledge of this want which induced the compilation of the collection here presented.
              The movements which it contains have been already illustrated and described in occasional installments scattered through five volumes of the
              AMERICAN ARTISAN, by the readers of which their publication was received with so much favor as was believed to warrant the expense of their
              reproduction with some revision in a separate volume.
            </p>
            <p>
              The selection of the movements embraced in this collection has been made from many and various sources. The English works of Johnson, Willcock,
              Wylson, and Denison have been drawn upon to a considerable extent, and many other works—American and foreign—have been laid under contribution ;
              but more than one-fourth of the movements—many of purely American origin—have never previously appeared in any published collection. Although the
              collection embraces about three times as many movements as have ever been contained in any previous American publication, and a considerably
              larger number than has ever been contained in any foreign one, it has not been the object of the compiler to merely swell the number, but he has
              endeavored to select only such as may be of really practical value ; and with this end in view, he has rejected many which are found in nearly all
              the previously published collections, but which he has considered only applicable to some exceptional want.
            </p>
            <p>
              Owing to the selection of these movements at such intervals as could be snatched from professional duties, which admitted of no postponement, and
              to the engravings having been made from time to time for immediate publication, the classification of the movements is not as perfect as the
              compiler could have desired; yet it is believed that this deficiency is more than compensated for by the copiousness of the Index and the entirely
              novel arrangement of the illustrations and the descriptive letter-press on opposite pages, which make the collection—large and comprehensive as it
              is—more convenient for reference than any previous one.

            <div>
              <p>Given to the Newark Museum by Louis Bamberger and Exhibited May-October, 1930</p>
              <p>NOTE</p>
              <p>
                In the spring of 1928 a pamphlet telling of an exhibit of working mechanical models to be seen in New York in the Boys' Department of a
                department store, came to Mr. Dana's attention. The maker of the exhibition, Mr. W. M. Clark, was interviewed and asked to lend the exhibit to
                the Museum, but it was found it would cost several hundred dollars for transportation and installation, and the exhibit was given up.
              </p>
              <p>
                More than a year later Mr. Louis Bamberger talked with Mr. Dana about this same exhibit of Mechanical Models and Mr. Dana told Mr. Bamberger of
                his desire to show this exhibit in the Museum. Mr. Bamberger then decided to present these models, appropriately mounted and labeled, to the
                Museum.
              </p>
              <p>
                The exhibit consists of ten sections, each measuring 5 feet 6 inches by 5 feet 8 inches, and weighing from 475 to 550 pounds apiece. In each
                section are sixteen small panels 15¼ inches square, each containing one or more movements. The sections are mounted on legs 16 inches high and
                are provided with covers both back and front so arranged that they can be handled exactly like a piano. The exhibit can be set up or taken down
                in a few hours. Each individual panel is connected electrically so that the visitor may set things in motion by pressing a button.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Museum plans to lend the exhibit under certain conditions, to museums and other institutions which are equipped to set it up with the care
                required and to transport it.
              </p>
              <p>Mr. W. M. Clark of South Orange is the inventor and maker of the Mechanical Exhibit.</p>
              <p>
                From his early youth Mr. Clark has been interested in machines and has always had a great desire to visualize the science of mechanics. His work
                of twenty years or more in perfecting the exhibit was inspired by a wish to give to inventors and to all who deal in machine technique a short
                cut to their various ends. The first exhibit made by Mr. Clark is now in the Museum of the Peaceful Arts in New York City. The second set is a
                gift to the Newark Museum by Mr. Louis Bamberger.
              </p>
              <p>
                Miss Virginia Downward, Head of the Science Department, aided by Mr. Clark, wrote the labels which present the story of each movement to the
                visitor.
              </p>
              <p>This exhibit will be of tremendous interest not only to a city like Newark with its many industries, but to the State as well.</p>
              <p>In connection with this exhibition the Public Library has an alcove of books, pamphlets and periodicals devoted to the subject.</p>

            </h3>
            <div>
              <p>
                This collection of illustrations and descriptions of "Mechanical Movements" was originally published in the "American Artisan," a publication
                edited by Mr. Henry T. Brown, deceased, a prominent patent attorney, nationally known.
              </p>

              <p>
                Mr. Brown was the senior member of Brown & Seward, patent attorneys, at 270 Broadway, New York City, enjoying an enviable reputation in the
                prosecuting of patent applications and all the work relative thereto.
              </p>

              <p>
                A copy of this book, as originally published, was purchased, years ago, by the creator of "Mechanical Wonderland," Mr. W. M. Clark, of South
                Orange, New Jersey, a lover of mechanics who used it as a text book in his study of mechanics, which was his natural "Hobby."
              </p>

              <p>
                Mr. Clark, through its help, acquired the foundation for a mechanical education, without schooling in the regular way, which inspired the
                conception, designing and building of a large exhibit, nationally known as "Mechanical Wonderland."
              </p>

              <p>
                This exhibit visualizes the art and science of mechanics, so that those, like himself, who had no opportunity to get this education in the
                schools, can now get a quick grasp of it.
              </p>

              <p>
                The Exhibit, "Mechanical Wonderland," is a collection of over 200 mechanical movements, devices and combinations of movements, showing every
                movement used in this art, either separately or in combination.
              </p>

              <p>
                Several of these exhibits have been built, the first one being in the Science Museum of New York City, the last one being purchased by Mr. Louis
                Bamberger of Newark, New Jersey, and presented to the Newark Museum for permanent installation, where it has been viewed and studied by
                thousands of craftsmen, scientists, inventors, teachers and educational bodies, schools and colleges, together with those prominent in
                industries in the metropolitan area.
              </p>

              <p>
                Over 135,000 people saw it in the "Grand Central Palace" in New York City in one week's period, when exhibited there. Inquiries were received
                from all parts of the United States, as well as from other countries concerning its installation in museums, educational institutions and
                industrial centers.
              </p>

              <p>It has the endorsement of leading educators, colleges, industrial men and technical organizations throughout the country.</p>

              <p>
                The Exposition, "A Century of Progress," affords a splendid opportunity to bring to the attention of all those interested in visual education,
                the application of this method in their own centers.
              </p>

              <p>The inspiration gotten from "Mechanical Wonderland" will prove the worth of this volume, which inspired its building.</p>

              <p>This edition is dedicated to "A Century of Progress." W. M. CLARK.</p>

                John Cotton Dana's concept that a museum "should reflect our industries, be stimulating and helpful to our workers; promote an interest in the
                products of our shops," and his desire "to make adult Americans more pleased and proud of the mechanical achievements of their countrymen; and
                to arouse in the young an interest to do all kinds of things from the driving of a nail with a hammer to the construction of a motor car," lead
                him in 1926 to inquire about an exhibition of mechanical models on display in a New York department store. This exhibition, the life work of a
                New Jersey inventor, Mr. William M. Clark, consisted of panels on which were mounted one hundred-sixty working models, showing the fundamentals
                of mechanical movement, beginning with the first principles and covering the development, both practical and experimental, in a more or less
                natural sequence. What Mr. Clark had succeeded in doing was to condense into simple, compact, and easily operated models all the movements or
                combinations of movements used in mechanics. The first set he designed and constructed went to the New York Museum of Science and Industry,
                known at that time, in 1929, as The Museum of Peaceful Arts. This set now belongs to the Museum of Science, Boston. After Mr. Dana's death in
                1929, Mr. Louis Bamberger ordered a second set of this "dictionary of mechanical movements" for the Newark Museum.
              </p>

              <p>
                The models have been on exhibition continuously since 1930 with a few interruptions when they were lent to Mr. Clark for the Chicago World's
                Fairs of 1933 and 1934, and to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1937 for display during the Annual Meeting of the Society for the
                Promotion of Engineering Education.
              </p>

              <p>
                The thousands of people who have viewed this exhibition in the past twenty-four years have found considerable enjoyment in studying the
                mechanical operations presented effectively in it. It gives us pleasure to bring to our members and friends the following history of the
                principles of mechanical movements prepared by Kenneth Gosner of our Science Department Staff.

              Mechanical Models: A Collection of the Newark Museum By Kenneth L. Gosner
              <a href="#16"><sup>16</sup></a>
            </h3>

            <p>
              For most of us who are not trained engineers, the insides of a clock, a typewriter, or the mysteries hidden under the hood of a modern automobile
              present a picture of baffling complexity and even confusion. It is usually enough if the machine does what it is intended to, if its parts move
              according to the engineer's design. When this does not occur, when the machine fails, we are lost, frustrated, and usually annoyed. Then we
              anxiously call for the mechanic. Constantly we are confronted by the latest marvels of a highly technological era. If we are not familiar with the
              machines themselves we are at least familiar with their resulting product. Surprising then that an understanding of the principles of mechanical
              movements, which are so important in our civilization, has become more and more the province of engineers and mechanics alone.
            </p>

            <p>
              The mechanical fittings of our culture result from the application of but a few principles, a few compared to the multitude of devices based on
              them. The inclined plane, lever, wedge, and pulley, together with the wheel and axle and the screw, are often called the six elements of
              mechanical movement—the six "simple machines." They provide the basis for mechanical invention. Nor are these the exclusive property of mankind or
              the product of his imagination alone. Simple machines may be found in the animal kingdom and elsewhere in nature. To take a familiar example—the
              mosquito. The mosquito flies and walks by manipulating the levers that make up her leg and wing attachments. The same mosquito, if she has the
              opportunity, makes effective use of a wedge when she punctures the skin in search of nourishment. Birds, which have been flying since Jurassic
              times or more than a hundred million years before man's labored efforts to get off the ground were successful, raise their wings by an arrangement
              of bone, muscle, and tendon which approximates the pulley in principle. When animals first climbed up out of the sea to conquer land habitats they
              very probably used the principle of the inclined plane.
            </p>

            <p>
              Elementary machines, as well as fundamental mechanical movements and such complex pieces of machinery as an automobile engine, are shown in an
              operating exhibit of Mechanical Models in the Museum. One hundred-sixty movements and inventions are shown, and the photographs illustrating this
              text are taken from the exhibition. Historically the exhibit may be said to cover the period from man's earliest use of tools other than his own
              hands to the present age of internal combustion engines, turbines, and steam locomotives.
            </p>

            <p>
              Examples of the use of the inclined plane, lever, and wedge are found abundantly in nature, and these few simple machines were employed by early
              man in the fashioning of tools. The use of mechanical devices goes back far beyond the limits of recorded history. The inclined plane and the
              lever were perhaps the first mechanical elements put to work. The principle of the wedge, which is really a form of the inclined plane, came into
              use when early human hunters and fishermen sharpened sticks to make the first spears. Later the wedge formed the basis of the sharp cutting edges
              of stone knives and projectile points.
            </p>

            <p>
              As long as man followed a meager existence gathering the roots, nuts, berries, and fruits that grew around him, or was satisfied to fill out this
              vegetable diet with game and fish, his technology remained a relatively simple one. Later he began to perfect the techniques of agriculture,
              growing his own crops of corn and rice and domesticating dogs, pigs, and horses. But man's progress in improving the tools with which he worked
              went slowly. The discovery of fire gave him a means of improving the qualities of some of the tools that he already had and of using previously
              untried raw materials in perfecting new implements. The use of metals began with the smelting of simple ores and the pounding into useful shapes
              of native metals. The inclined plane, lever, and wedge, unassisted by other mechanical elements, continued to serve as the foundation of applied
              mechanics even into the period of ancient civilization. With simple mechanisms the Egyptian architects of 5000 years ago built the pyramids.
              During most of this long struggle, muscle power provided the force to accomplish human undertakings. Manpower alone raised tons of granite and
              limestone blocks into the fantastic pyramids of ancient Egypt, hundreds of thousands of men laboring for twenty years or more to accomplish this.
