      <h2>Definition</h2>
  <p>    A universal joint (U-joint) is a mechanical joint connecting shafts to transmit rotary motion. It consists of a pair of hinges located close together, oriented at 90° to each other, connected by a cross shaft.
      </p>

	<!-- 
        The spider has 4 spokes that fit into holes of the yokes, enabling it to rotate. 
In real life use, the ends of the spokes are covered by caps holding cylinder “needle” bearings to reduce friction.
Universal joints are typically designed to protect the internal parts from dirt.
A universal joint can be seen under trucks.
Key Facts
The rotational velocity of the output shaft is not constant. It will speed up and slow down during a rotation, causing wobble.
The greater the angle, the bigger the wobble
You can eliminate the wobble by putting 2 universal joints together “Double Cardan Joint”
There are other joints that are ‘constant velocity’, but are more complex (see other mechanisms)
A universal joint can be seen under trucks.
Engineering Rules of Thumb
Generally want to keep the angle below 35°, with a max angle of 45°.

Weird Fact
In antiquity, it was noticed that the math between the two joints looks the same as the seasonal variation of day length across the year.  And it is! The earth’s North/South axis is angled 23 degrees from the axis of its orbit around the Sun.
Variations
Because of the vibrations, a single Universal Joint is rarely used.  The Double Cardan Joint is very common, either with the 2 Universal joints together, or separated by a intermediate shaft.
The angle for both joints must be the same to avoid wobble.

History
The universal joint idea has been around since antiquity, and been discovered or documented multiple times, for example by Gerolamo Cardano, in the 16th century and Robert Hooke, in the 17th century.

Math
The rotational speed of the follower shaft will vary based on the angle. This can be calculated.
