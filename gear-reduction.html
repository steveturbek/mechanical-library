    Early gears were made from wood with cylindrical pegs for cogs and were often lubricated with animal fat grease. Gears were also used in wind and water wheel machinery for decreasing or increasing the provided rotational speed for application to pumps and other powered machines. An early gear arrangement used to power textile machinery is illustrated in the following figure. The rotational speed of a water or horse drawn wheel was typically too slow to use, so a set of wooden gears needed to be used to increase the speed to a usable level.
    The industrial revolution in Britain in the eighteenth century saw an explosion in the use of metal gearing. A science of gear design and manufacture rapidly developed through the nineteenth century.

Today, the most significant new gear developments are in the area of materials. Modern metallurgy has greatly increased the useful life of industrial and automotive gears, and consumer electronics has driven plastic gearing to new levels of lubricant-free reliability and quiet operation.

Law of Gearing
The common normal at the point of contact between a pair of teeth must always pass through the pitch point for all mating gear positions, according to the law of gearing. The design of the gear profile is based on this law. This is a must for the two gears to function properly.
The angular velocity between two mating gears always remains constant. Therefore, from the Law of gearing we can derive the relationship as:
where w is angular velocity of gear, n is the gear speed, d is the pitch diameter of the gear, T is number of teeth on the gear.


Effect of gear ratio on speed:
The configuration is known as reduction gear drive when the number of gears on the output shaft is more than the
number of gears on the input shaft. The speed of output shaft will be les than the input shaft.

                    The output shaft will have a higher speed than the input shaft if the configuration is reversed, i.e. the number of gears on the output shaft is less than the number of gears on the input shaft.
The best example to understand this is the automotive gear box. For lower speeds, we must drive in the low gears (1st or 2nd gear) but as the speed increases we shift to higher gears.
Gear trains are created when two or more gears are made to interfere with each other in order to transmit power from one shaft to another. In a vehicle, power is transferred from engine to the wheels through the gearbox.
A gear assembly with two or more gears is commonly referred to as a Gear Train!
  Types of gear train:
There are generally four types of gear trains.
Simple Gear Train Compound Gear Trains Reverted gear Trains Epicyclic Gear Trains
Simple Gear Trains:
A simple gear train is made up of single gear connected to each shaft, one linked to the drive shaft (input) and the other to the driven shaft (output). The motion of the driver gear and the motion of the driven gear will always be in the opposing directions for a simple two geared train.
In a multi geared simple gear train, the gear which is not connected to drive shaft of driven shaft is called as idler.

  Simple Gear Train Assembly
 Where n is the speed of the respective gear.
Compound Gear Trains:
In a compound gear train, the intermediate gear is a compounded gear i.e. there will be more than one gear on the intermediate axil/shaft. The co-axially connected gears will rotate with same speed, but will have different outputs.
Compound Gear Train Assembly
Where n is the speed of the respective gear.
Reverted Gear Trains:
The compound gear train where the input and output gears are on the same axis is know as reverted gear train. The input and output shafts are aligned on the same axis, and they rotate at different speeds. This type of assembly is optimal for compact spaces.
   
 
Reverted Gear Train Assembly
Where n is the speed of the respective gear.
Epicyclic Gear Trains:
One of the most complex and widely used gear train assembly is the Epicyclic gear train. An epicyclic gear train (also known as a planetary gearset) is made up of two gears with the center of one rotating around the center of the other. A carrier connects the two gears' centers and turns the planet and sun gears' pitch circles so that they roll without slipping. An epicycloid curve is traced by a point on the planet gear's pitch circle. The solar gear is fixed in this simplified example, while the planetary gears rotate around it.

The angular velocity between two mating gears always remains constant.
A gear assembly with two or more gears is commonly referred to as a Gear Train. Different types of gear trains have different application.
Epicyclic gear train is one of the complex gear assemblies. It is used in watch and even in automatic transmissions in vehicles.


The torque produced at the output shaft is Gear Ratio times the torque produced at the input shaft.
